# Betting Website
## Approach
I chose to use create-react-app, nodejs and materialui to create this project. I have experience using nodejs but have limited experience in react.
I chose to use this project as a way of learning react a bit more. I chose materialui to ensure that the project would look the same on the device used to test it.
The project is a single page application and is split into three components (Dashboard, Event & Betslip).
Any feedback would be appreciated.
